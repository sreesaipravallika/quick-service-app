# ✅ H2 Database - WORKING Connection!

## 🎯 CORRECT Connection Settings

### Open H2 Console
**URL**: http://localhost:8082

### Use These EXACT Settings:

```
Saved Settings:   Generic H2 (Server)
Driver Class:     org.h2.Driver
JDBC URL:         jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/quickserv
User Name:        sa
Password:         (leave blank - just click Connect)
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Use This JDBC URL

```
jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/~/quickserv
```

The `~/` means it will use your home directory, avoiding path issues with spaces.
