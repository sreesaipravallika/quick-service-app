# ✅ Location Popup - Now Shows Every Time!

## 🎉 What Changed

Modified the LocationSelector to show the popup **every time you login**, even if location is already saved!

### Previous Behavior:
- ❌ Popup only showed once (stored in localStorage)
- ❌ Never showed again after first time

### New Behavior:
- ✅ Popup shows every time you login (new session)
- ✅ Uses sessionStorage instead of localStorage
- ✅ Resets when you close the browser/tab
- ✅ Shows again on next login

## 🧪 How to Test

### Method 1: Refresh the Page
1. Simply refresh: `Ctrl + R`
2. ✅ Popup appears immediately!

### Method 2: Logout and Login Again
1. Logout from dashboard
2. Login again: john@plumbing.com / password123
3. ✅ Popup appears!

### Method 3: Close and Reopen Browser
1. Close the browser tab
2. Open http://localhost:5173 again
3. Login
4. ✅ Popup appears!

## 🔄 How It Works Now

### Every Login/Page Load:
```
1. User opens app or refreshes page
2. Dashboard loads
3. 🎉 POPUP APPEARS: "Enable Location Access"
4. User can:
   - Allow Location Access (triggers browser permission)
   - Enter Manually (select from city list)
   - Skip for now (closes popup)
```

### During Same Session:
```
1. User sees popup once
2. Makes a choice (allow/manual/skip)
3. Popup won't show again until:
   - Page is refreshed
   - Browser tab is closed and reopened
   - User logs out and logs back in
```

## 📝 Technical Details

### Changed from localStorage to sessionStorage:
- **localStorage**: Persists forever (even after closing browser)
- **sessionStorage**: Clears when tab/browser is closed

### Code Change:
```javascript
// OLD (localStorage - persists forever):
localStorage.setItem("qs_location_prompt_seen", "true");

// NEW (sessionStorage - clears on tab close):
sessionStorage.setItem("qs_location_prompt_seen", "true");
```

## 🎯 When Popup Shows

### ✅ Popup WILL Show:
- Every time you refresh the page
- Every time you login
- After closing and reopening browser
- After clearing sessionStorage
- In new browser tabs

### ❌ Popup WON'T Show (during same session):
- After you've already seen it once
- While navigating within the app
- Until you refresh or reopen

## 🔍 Verify It's Working

### Check sessionStorage:
Press `F12` → Console → Run:
```javascript
console.log('Session:', sessionStorage.getItem('qs_location_prompt_seen'));
// Should be: "true" (after seeing popup once)
// Will be: null (after refresh/reopen)
```

### Clear sessionStorage to test again:
```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem('qs_location_prompt_seen');
location.reload();
// Popup appears again!
```
