```

## 🎯 What You'll See in Provider Dashboard

### Header Layout (Left to Right):
```
[🛠️ QuickServIndia Provider] [Welcome, John] [🟢 Available] [📍 Location] [🚪 Logout]
```

### Location Button:
- Shows: "Select Location" (if not set)
- Or: "Mumbai, Maharashtra" (if location is set)
- Click to open location dropdown
- Click "Use Current Location" to trigger browser permission

## 🌐 Location Popup Actions

### 1. Allow Location Access
- Triggers browser's geolocation permission dialog
- Browser asks: "Allow localhost:5173 to access your location?"
- If allowed: Fetches city/state using GPS coordinates
- Saves location to localStorage
- Shows in header: "City, State"

### 2. Enter Manually
- Opens dropdown with popular Indian cities
- Search for your city
- Click to select
- Saves to localStorage

### 3. Skip for now
- Closes popup
- Can access location selector anytime via header button
- Popup won't show again (stored in localStorage)

## 🔄 Testing Multiple Times

To test the popup again:

**Quick Reset (Console Method):**
```javascript
// Press F12, paste in console:
localStorage.removeItem('qs_location');
localStorage.removeItem('qs_location_prompt_seen');
location.reload();
```

**Or use Incognito mode** - Fresh session every time!

## 📱 Browser Permission Dialog

After clicking "Allow Location Access", your browser shows:

**Chrome/Edge:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  localhost:5173 wants to:           │
│  ○ Know your location               │
│                                     │
│  [Block]  [Allow]                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Firefox:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Share your location with           │
│  localhost:5173?                    │
│                                     │
│  [Not Now]  [Allow]                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
