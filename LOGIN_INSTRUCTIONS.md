### "Unable to connect to server"
- Check if backend is running: http://localhost:8080/api/health
- Should show: `{"status":"ok","message":"QuickServ API is running"}`
- If not running, restart backend: `cd backend && npm start`

### "Email already registered"
- This email is already in use
- Try logging in instead of registering
- Or use a different email
