GROUP BY role;
```

### View Table Structure
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM users;
```

### Insert New Customer

SELECT 
  b.id,
  b.service_type,
  b.location,
  b.service_date,

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### If connection fails:
1. Make sure H2 server is running (check terminal)
2. Use the exact JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/./h2-data/quickserv`
3. Username is `sa` (lowercase)
4. Password is empty (just leave it blank)

### If you see "database not found":
The database has already been created at `backend/h2-data/quickserv.mv.db`
