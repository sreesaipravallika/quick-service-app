# ✅ QuickServ - FIXED AND RUNNING!

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

The application had a **build error** that prevented it from loading in the browser:
- `ProviderDashboard.tsx` was importing `api` from `@/lib/api.ts`
- But `api.ts` didn't export an `api` object
- This caused the React app to fail silently in the browser

## ✅ What I Fixed

Added the missing `api` export to `src/lib/api.ts`:
```typescript
export const api = {
  get: async (endpoint) => { ... },
  post: async (endpoint, data) => { ... },
  put: async (endpoint, data) => { ... },
  delete: async (endpoint) => { ... },
};
```

## 🚀 Application is NOW RUNNING

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173 ✅
