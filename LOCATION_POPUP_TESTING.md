# 🗺️ Location Popup - Testing Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Location Popup Only Shows on Customer Dashboard

The location permission popup is currently only implemented on the **Customer Dashboard**, not the Provider Dashboard.

## 🧪 How to Test the Location Popup

### Step 1: Logout from Provider Account
If you're currently logged in as a provider, logout first.

### Step 2: Login as Customer
Use these credentials:
```
Email: sreesaipravallika26@gmail.com
Password: password123
```

### Step 3: Clear Location Data (Important!)
Before logging in, clear the location data:

**Option A: Use Incognito Mode (Easiest)**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + N` (Chrome) or `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Firefox)
2. Go to: http://localhost:5173
3. Login with customer credentials above

**Option B: Clear Browser Storage**
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
2. Go to **Application** tab (Chrome) or **Storage** tab (Firefox)
3. Click **Local Storage** → **http://localhost:5173**
4. Delete these keys:
   - `qs_location`
   - `qs_location_prompt_seen`
5. Close DevTools and refresh page

### Step 4: See the Popup!
After logging in as a customer, you should immediately see:

## 🎯 Where is LocationSelector Used?

Currently, LocationSelector is only on:
- ✅ **Customer Dashboard** (`/dashboard`)

NOT on:
- ❌ Provider Dashboard (`/provider-dashboard`)
- ❌ Admin Dashboard (`/admin-dashboard`)
- ❌ Login/Register pages

## 🔧 Want Location Popup on Provider Dashboard?

If you want the location popup to also appear for providers, I can add it. Let me know!

The provider might need location for:
- Setting their service area
- Viewing nearby customers
- Managing service locations

## 📝 Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Logout from current account
- [ ] Open incognito window (`Ctrl + Shift + N`)
- [ ] Go to http://localhost:5173
- [ ] Login as customer: sreesaipravallika26@gmail.com / password123
- [ ] ✅ Location popup should appear immediately!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Popup Still Not Showing?

1. **Check you're on Customer Dashboard**
   - URL should be: `http://localhost:5173/dashboard`
   - NOT: `http://localhost:5173/provider-dashboard`

2. **Check Browser Console (F12)**
   - Look for any JavaScript errors
   - Check if LocationSelector component is rendering

3. **Verify localStorage is clear**
   ```javascript
   // In console (F12):
   console.log(localStorage.getItem('qs_location_prompt_seen'));
   // Should return: null
   ```

4. **Hard Refresh**
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + R` or `Ctrl + F5`

## 🎨 Popup Styling

The popup should have:
- Semi-transparent dark overlay
- Centered modal with gradient icon
- Three action buttons
- Smooth fade-in animation

If you see a blank screen or no overlay, there might be a CSS issue.

## 🔍 Debug Mode

To force show the popup for testing:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Run this code:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('qs_location');
localStorage.removeItem('qs_location_prompt_seen');
location.reload();
```

This will reset everything and trigger the popup on next page load.
